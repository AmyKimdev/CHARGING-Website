## 2. Project Goal

**Discussion on Insights Derived from Data Analysis and Challenges in Web Services**

- Analysis of yearly electric vehicle (EV) sales data using the Bass model concluded that sales would increase until 2032, followed by a decline starting in 2033.
- The primary factors influencing EV purchases were found to be economic (government subsidies, reduced charging costs) and environmental (reduction in carbon emissions).
- The reason for creating an EV community was based on the projection that EV sales would decline from 2032. It was determined that maximizing word-of-mouth (WoM) effects could mitigate this forecasted decline in sales.
- It was assessed that to maximize WoM, access to honest reviews was crucial. Currently, there are few platforms where people can obtain information about EVs, resulting in insufficient WoM effects and an increase in unsold EV stocks.
- Therefore, this community was intended to prevent and address potential future issues through enhanced information sharing and engagement.
